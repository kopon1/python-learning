# URGENT MEMO FROM BIG BALLS INC.
TO: @casper_z33 
FROM: Mr. Bigglesworth, CEO of Big Balls Inc.
RE: The Fate of the Company Lies in Your Hands

Listen kid,

You're not just a trainee anymore. You're now our lead (and only) Python Engineer at Big Balls Inc.—the most respected (and only) ball conglomerate in the tri-county area. And we’ve got a code red.

## :firecracker: THE SITUATION:
Our ball-tracking software is down. The intern tried to rewrite it using Excel formulas and now it thinks a basketball is a kind of fruit. We need a terminal-based Python program that can do what no spreadsheet ever could: track our inventory and sales with the raw power of code.

You're the only one who can do this. Everyone else here just forwards emails and plays foosball. You must deliver. The company's reputation (and balls) are on the line.

## :briefcase: YOUR MISSION:
Build a Python terminal app that does the following:

## :shopping_cart: Inventory & Sales Tracker:
**Load/Save CSV Files**
On startup, read from a CSV file (e.g., inventory.csv) that has our current stock.
Save updates to CSV when exiting.

**Balls We Sell**
- Basketballs
- Yoga Balls
- Bouncy Balls
(feel free to add more, but we don’t do bowling balls after the incident)

**User Menu Options**
- Record a Sale (reduce stock, store sale info with date)
- Record a Purchase (increase stock, pretend we bought more from suppliers)
- View Current Inventory
- View Monthly Report (input: year + month, output: number of each type sold in that month)

**Exit and Save**

**Data Format Ideas (CSV)**
inventory.csv: ball_type,quantity
sales.csv: ball_type,date,quantity
purchases.csv: ball_type,date,quantity

Assume everything happens in the current year unless told otherwise.

## :tools: THINGS TO USE:
- Lists and dictionaries (your weapons of choice)
- CSV reading/writing
- datetime module to get dates right
- Loops, ifs, whiles — use your training

## :receipt: BONUS POINTS (optional but makes you look good):
- Validate input (no selling -3 balls please, we don’t have ghost balls)
- Use functions to keep it tidy
- Add some witty terminal text (branding matters)

The previous developer that quit last week did some ground work that you should be able to find in your repository. Hopefuly its enough to kickstart the solution.

You got this. And remember our motto:
“When the world drops the ball… **we pick it up and sell it.**”

Sincerely,
Mr. Bigglesworth
CEO, Big Balls Inc.

PS: This needs to be done by the end of the month or we will all be looking for a new job. No pressure kid.
