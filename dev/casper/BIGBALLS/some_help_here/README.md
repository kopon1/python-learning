Hey man,

If you're reading this, Iâ€™ve already quit Big Balls Inc. Iâ€™m sorry. I just couldnâ€™t do it anymore. After 3 years knee-deep in yoga balls and quarterly reports, I realized my true calling is competitive cheese sculpting. Iâ€™ve moved to a farm in the Alps.

Anyway, I didnâ€™t leave you totally in the dark. That function outline? Thatâ€™s your blueprint. I was halfway through rebuilding the system before I rage-quit.

Why it matters:
Each function is meant to do one job. Load stuff, save stuff, handle sales, track purchases, show reports, and manage the flow. Think of them like little gears in a bigger machine. Keeping them separate makes it easier to fix stuff and not cry into your keyboard.

Start with main_menu() â€” thatâ€™s the entry point. The rest are helpers. Build each one bit by bit and feel free to put them in their own files (modules) and importing them as you need them. 
Donâ€™t try to code the whole thing at once unless you enjoy chaos.

Youâ€™re smart, and honestly, you care more than I did in my last six months. Keep it clean, keep it readable, and donâ€™t forget: validate your input (unless you want negative balls flying around).

Good luck and fuck Biggles.
